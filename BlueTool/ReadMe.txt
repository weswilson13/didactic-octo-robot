Outstanding questions/to-dos:
    PRD - should this be linked to AccountExpirationDate????
        - if so, is there a reason to have the Modify Expiration Date logic/functionality?

    Validate Notepad user - currently this just updates the Windows Login Field. 
                          - What else (if anything) should be updated in Notepad?

    Need to update Rate and Office queries (config.ini) with proper table and fields.

    Need to update correct AD mapping in config.ini

    Incorporate Helper and Exam account logic. Need Jim's direction/feedback.

    Reset/Cancel button?

    ASD Stig and actual help file. Maybe incorporate into "Home" console display. 

    Configure logging table - currently set to Computers DB. Does this make sense?

    Validate Notepad user function -> update WinLogonID field to correct field and value (currently uses UserPrincipalName attribute)
