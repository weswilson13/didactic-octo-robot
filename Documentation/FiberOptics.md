# Cable Components:
![alt text](fiber.jpg)
 * outer cable jacket
 * strenth member
    * tensile strength for pulling cable
 * buffer
    * provides protection for fiber core
    * tight buffer
      * thermoplastic coating surrounding fiber. Greater flexibility. Used indoors for tighter turns etc.
    * loose buffer
      * increased protection. usually used outside (burying, etc.)
 * fiber
   * coating
   - cladding
   - core

# Cable Types:
![alt text](fiber-cable-construction.png)
 ## Simplex
   * single core, one-way transmission
   * cheap
   * easy to make
 ## Duplex
   * 2 fiber cores
   * 1 transmit
   * 1 receive
 ## Multi-Fiber
   * 2 to 800 strands
   * pairs of two (1 tx 1 rx)

# Transmission Modes:
 ## Single Mode
 - small micron core (typically 8 microns, but can range 8-10 microns)
 - light travels in straight line down the core
	- fastest speed
	- use over long distances (WANs)
 ## MultiMode
 - large diameter core (typically 62.5 microns but can range from 50-100 microns)
 - bounces/reflects as it travels down core
 - use more in LANs
 
# Fiber Color Code - up to 12 fibers in the following order
 - Blue 	(1)
 - Orange 	(2)
 - Green 	(3)
 - Brown 	(4)
 - Slate 	(5)
 - White 	(6)
 - Red 		(7)
 - Black 	(8)
 - Yellow 	(9)
 - Violet 	(10)
 - Rose 	(11)
 - Aqua 	(12)

 For cables with more than 12 strands of fiber, additional bundles may be used and color coded.

 e.g. - 
 * 1 bundle in a blue buffer (loose tube) will have 12 colored strands from blue to aqua (identified above). These will be strands 1 - 12.
 * 1 bundle in an orange buffer (loose tube) will have 12 colored strands from blue to aqua (identified above). These will be strands 13 - 24.

# Transmission Setup
 * A light source to transmit the signal (LED or Laser)
   * Lasers are more expensive and can travel greater distances before attenuating and needing amplification. Generally used in WAN connections
 * A receiver to receive the signal and convert to usable data

# Light Spectrum
 * Wavelengths of light used are typically either:
   * 850 nm (multimode fiber)
   * 1300 nm (multimode or singlemode fiber)
   * 1550 nm (singlemode fiber only)
 
 * These wavelenghts belong to the Infrared spectrum

 * The larger the wavelength, the smaller the fiber - smaller fiber translates to better performance

 * it is important to match up the transmitters, receivers, and cabling to ensure compatibility. 
   - question - can multimode cabling be used with single mode transmitters/receivers?
